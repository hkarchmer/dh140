## Response to Rachel Levine on using Open Street Maps for humanitarian causes
I found Rachel's presentation to be very informative and inspiring. It helped open my mind to the possibilities that arise when data and people who want to do good in the world come together. I am invigorated by the prospect that my colleagues and I can use open data to make the world a better place. For some time –  at least to me – it has felt as though data and data science, the numbers and charts and numbers-based studies I read in the news and many other places, are out completely of reach, in someone else’s – anyone else’s – hands. I have long accepted these numbers and what’s already out there for what it is. But Rachel’s presentation reminded me that I can play an active role in how data is compiled, analyzed, and presented. If I want to fight climate change, and help create a more equitable and just society, then it’s going to take a critical, engaged, and community-centered approach. It was fascinating to see the comparison of OpenStreetMaps soon after it started versus what it looks like today. The fact that certain places with thriving communities did not appear on a map – as thought they didn’t exist at all – still baffles me. But it’s people like these volunteers at OpenStreetMaps, who are seeking to fill the gaps in data, who are making a difference. And thi is how I believe my colleagues and I, too, will be able to use data to make the world a better place. We can choose not to ignore the biases and gaps in data, and instead struggle toward uncovering the truth, in searcch of fair representation and justice for all. Now that I’m getting hands-on experience with data science and learning about open data projects like OpenStreetMaps, these solutions to the most pressing problems of our time no longer feel as out of reach as they once did.
