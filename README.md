## Profile
My name is Haley Karchmer – Welcome to my Data Science project space for DH140! I am a third year psychology major with minors in digital humanities and environmental systems and society. 
## DH 140 course description 
"The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of coding and data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in the humanities? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, data analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced spatial analysis will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize digital data for humanistic practices and research."
## Project ideas
For this project I am interested in investigating health / life expectancy by zip code, somehow incorporating the role of air pollution / location of hazardous waste sites, food deserts, and education.
I am also interested in consumer behavior and what motivates people to make decisions.
Additionally, I'm interested in investigating impacts on depression and anxiety OR happiness/prosocial behavior after a natural disaster.
## Objectives
My objectives for the class are to learn how to better critically evaluate and visualize data as well as form a foundational understanding and application of Python and garrner the skills to use public data to address social issues.
